# forced.kbd
#
# This kbd mapping file is loaded AFTER a matching disc image mapping file (if
# one is found). So these options override EVERYTHING! Use with care!


# One possible use for this would be to force BeebEm to NEVER start up with
# sound (no matter what old mapping files say)!
#SET VOLUME=0

# Disable the hardware cursor always.
#SET DISABLE_CURSOR=1
